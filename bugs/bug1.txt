Unaccounted differences in running times

Commit e0327f9ed480f13eff35cfb953ed4465eeb99dd2 allows the
eigensolver to detect independent subproblems. Nevertheless, there are
noticeable differences in the running times of the solver even for those matrix
pencils, where there is only a single subproblem. These are
- gyro_k, gyro_m (678s vs 730s wallclock time)
- vanbody (1627s vs 1841s)
- ct20stif (1836s vs 1700s)
- bmw7st_1 (1271s vs 1203s)
